Introductory Text
*****************

This is a webpage about Sphinx and reStructured Text.

Add some more information.

I have some more things to say.

Every now and then I am going to want to put a *species* name in my text.

I may want something in **bold**.

	I have an indented paragraph.
	
	
This is a \*word*\.

``*word*`` see this as it really is


List Items
==========

	* itema
	* itemb
	* itemc
	
	1.) enumerated list
		A. just like before, it remembers the indents.
			1.) I can have mutliple levels of lists.
			
* main bullet

	- secondary bullet

		+ even another bullet
		
definition
	this is a defintion here
	
I would like the next thing to look like it did::
	
	jkjhjkshkjdsafkjsadfkjfhjkkjahdfkajhfjkawef******kjsdh8888ajsk
	
	as long as it is indencted, it will ignore special characters
	
no more example

::
	
	9874982749384928439824u02342&%^*&(^*%^&*(*&^%^&*(

Sphinx only recognizes certain symbols
